# Tic Tac Toe app

The rules are described below :

1.  X always goes first.

2.  Players cannot play on a played position.

3.  Players alternate placing X’s and O’s on the board until either:

    i. One player has three in a row, horizontally, vertically or diagonally

    ii. All nine squares are filled.

4.  If a player is able to draw three X’s or three O’s in a row, that player wins.

5.  If all nine squares are filled and neither player has three in a row, the game is a draw.
